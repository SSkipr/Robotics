In Autodesk Inventor (CAD), the search function is limited to the folder you're currently in, which can be inefficient. To work around this, I've consolidated all the [contents](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor) into a single folder, allowing for easier and more effective searches.

**FILES WITHIN THE FOLDER ARE NOT MADE BY ME, RATHER [THESE PEOPLE](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor)**
